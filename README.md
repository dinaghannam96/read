Hello my begginer friend, 
First I should tell you how important to stay excited in program developing so your  learning journey becomes easier. So, basically today i am going to introduce to a thing called TERMINAL(commmand line), which is an interface based on texts. and we can enter commands through typing them on the keyboard and it will give us a feedback as a text just like the text you send first. you start your command with a prompt then add 'ls' command and few other commands and then you will have a result, yes it is this simple and it is intresting as well.

To open your terminal you should first check your system because it differs from one system to another, like linux and mac, and different options will appear.
and i should mention that there are many helpful shortcuts as refrences and resources, So GOOD LUCK my friend.
